# Topological Sort 📝

## What it does
- Orders tasks so each comes after the tasks it depends on.

## How it works
- Like preparing a sandwich: you must slice bread before spreading jam.

## Step-by-step example
- Tasks: slice bread, spread jam, eat
- Order becomes: slice → spread → eat

## Why it's useful
- Essential for scheduling with dependencies.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/topological_sort.py)
