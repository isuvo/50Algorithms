# Bubble Sort 🫧

## What it does
- Arranges a list from smallest to largest by swapping out-of-order neighbors.

## How it works
- Picture a row of books on a shelf: you compare two at a time and swap them if they are in the wrong order, like bubbles rising to the top.

## Step-by-step example
- Start with [4, 2, 1]
- Compare 4 and 2 → swap → [2, 4, 1]
- Compare 4 and 1 → swap → [2, 1, 4]
- Start again: compare 2 and 1 → swap → [1, 2, 4] ✔️

## Why it's useful
- Easy to understand for learning how sorting works.
