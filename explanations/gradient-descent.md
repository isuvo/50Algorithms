# Gradient Descent 🏔️

## What it does
- Finds a minimum by taking steps downhill.

## How it works
- Like a hiker descending a foggy mountain by always stepping downward.

## Step-by-step example
- Start at height10, step down to8, then7 until valley reached

## Why it's useful
- Training machine learning models.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/gradient_descent.py)
