# Bucket Sort ðŸª£

## What it does
- Distributes items into buckets and sorts each bucket.

## How it works
- Like tossing marbles into labeled buckets by size before sorting within each bucket.

## Step-by-step example
- Numbers [0.25,0.36,0.58] â†’ buckets for 0-0.3,0.3-0.6,0.6-0.9
- Sort each bucket then join

## Why it's useful
- Works well when data is uniformly spread.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/bucket_sort.py)
