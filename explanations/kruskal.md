# Kruskal 🕸️

## What it does
- Builds a cheapest network connecting all points.

## How it works
- Like connecting islands with the least expensive bridges first.

## Step-by-step example
- Edges costs: AB2, AC3, BC1
- Pick BC1, then AB2 → all islands connected

## Why it's useful
- Designs cost-effective networks like roads or cables.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/kruskal.py)
