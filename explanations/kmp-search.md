# KMP Search ðŸ”Ž

## What it does
- Finds a word in text by reusing previous match information.

## How it works
- Like skipping ahead in a song when the chorus doesnâ€™t match what you expect.

## Step-by-step example
- Text "ababc" and pattern "abc"
- Mismatch at third letter lets us skip to position3

## Why it's useful
- Efficient string matching without backtracking.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/kmp_search.py)
