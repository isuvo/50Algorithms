# Shell Sort 🛡️

## What it does
- Sorts distant elements first then reduces the gap.

## How it works
- Like arranging books by comparing ones far apart, then focusing on smaller gaps.

## Step-by-step example
- List [8,5,3,1] with gap2 → compare 8&3,5&1
- Reduce gap to1 → finish with insertion sort

## Why it's useful
- Improves on insertion sort by moving items faster.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/shell_sort.py)
