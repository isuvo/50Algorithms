# Exponentiation by Squaring ⬆️

## What it does
- Raises numbers to powers quickly by squaring.

## How it works
- Like doubling an exponent by squaring instead of multiplying many times.

## Step-by-step example
- Compute 3^5: square to get3^2=9, 3^4=81, multiply by3 →243

## Why it's useful
- Speeds up power calculations in cryptography.
