# Heap Sort ⛰️

## What it does
- Uses a heap to repeatedly remove the largest item and build a sorted list.

## How it works
- Like always taking the tallest stack of books off a pile to line them up.

## Step-by-step example
- Build heap from [4,1,3] → top is 4
- Remove 4 → heapify [1,3] top 3
- Result [1,3,4] after repeats

## Why it's useful
- Provides good worst-case performance.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/heap_sort.py)
