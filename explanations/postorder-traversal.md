## What it does
- Visits children before the node.

## How it works
- Like packing items in a box: place contents before sealing the box.

## Step-by-step example
- Tree root2 with children1 and3
- Visit1 â†’ 3 â†’ 2

## Why it's useful
- Helpful for deleting trees or evaluating expressions.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/postorder_traversal.py)
