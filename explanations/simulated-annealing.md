# Simulated Annealing ðŸ”¥

## What it does
- Searches for good solutions by occasionally accepting worse moves to escape traps.

## How it works
- Like cooling metal slowly so it settles into a strong structure.

## Step-by-step example
- Start with random arrangement, sometimes swap pieces even if result is worse, gradually reduce swaps

## Why it's useful
- Handles tough optimization problems where greedy methods get stuck.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/simulated_annealing.py)
