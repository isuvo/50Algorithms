# Fast Fourier Transform ðŸŽ¶

## What it does
- Breaks a signal into a mix of simple waves.

## How it works
- Like separating a song into basic tones.

## Step-by-step example
- Take 8 numbers representing sound
- Split and combine to reveal frequency strengths

## Why it's useful
- Used in music, images, and communications.

## Implementation
- [View code](../algorithms/fast_fourier_transform.py)
